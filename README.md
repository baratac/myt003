## Third assignment at [Ubiqum Code Academy](https://ubiqum.com)

The objective is to create a travel social app. Users can create their favourite locations (restaurante, art galery, whatever...) and added in their account and then link them together to generate itineraries make them available for other users to check, comment, rate and probably share. 

The final application is not fully develeped, although the trainging scope was fulfilled and elable the discovery of the mechanics of any application with frontend developed in React and a backend with Express and NodeJS acting as web server and MongoDB as the repository.

Not all was achieved during the training but what can be found here is working and can be checked here: [MyItineraries](https://mytineraries-cab21x65.surge.sh).

Main goals of the app, 
* Allow users to create their own lists of places of locations
* Other users will be able to rate and comment on this lists of places
* User management with Goggle SSO
* Responsive design
